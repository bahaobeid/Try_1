                <span id= Computerprog ></span>Computer</span> programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer
                program to accomplish a specific computing result. Programming involves <span id=taskpro>tasks </span>such as: 
                analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, 
                and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language
                (commonly referred to as coding).[1][2] The source code of a program is written
                in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code,
                which is directly executed by the central processing unit. <br>The <SPAN ID=purpose >purpose</SPAN> of programming is
                to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task 
                (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer,
                often for solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires 
                expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain,
                specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

                Tasks <span id=accompanying> accompanying</span> and related to programming include: testing, debugging, source code
                maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, 
                such as the machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part of the 
                programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process
                with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of code.
                Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices.

            <p>
                Reverse engineering is the opposite process. A hacker is any skilled computer expert that uses
                their technical knowledge to overcome a problem, but it can also mean a security hacker in
                common language.

                Programmable <span id= device>devices</span> have existed for centuries. As early as the 9th century, a programmable
                music sequencer was invented by the Persian Banu Musa brothers, who described an automated mechanical
                e player in the Book of Ingenious Devices.[3][4] In 1206, the Arab engineer Al-Jazari invented 
                a programmable drum machine where musical mechanical automaton could be made to play different rhythms
                and drum patterns, via pegs and cams.[5][6] In 1801, the Jacquard loom could produce entirely 
                different weaves by changing the "program" – a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them.

                Code-breaking algorithms have also existed for centuries. In the 9th century, the Arab mathematician
                Al-Kindi described a cryptographic algorithm for deciphering encrypted code, in A Manuscript 
                On Deciphering Cryptographic Messages. He gave the first description of cryptanalysis by frequency
                analysis, the earliest code-breaking algorithm.<br>

                <span id=first>The first</span> computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician Ada Lovelace published 
                an algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles 
                Babbage's Analytical Engine.[8]


                Data and instructions were once stored on external punched cards, which were kept in order and
                arranged in program decks.
                In the 1880s Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form.
                [9] Later a control panel (plugboard) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be 
                programmed for different jobs,

            <p>
                by the late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602
                and IBM 604, were programmed by control panels in a similar way; as were the first electronic 
                computers. However, with the concept of the stored-program computers introduced in 1949,
                both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in computer memory.
                [citation needed]

                Machine code was the language of early programs, written in the instruction set of the particular
                machine, often in binary notation. Assembly languages were soon developed that let the programmer
                specify instruction in a text format, (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation
                code and meaningful names for specifying addresses. However, because an assembly language is little
                more than a different notation for a machine language, any two machines with different instruction
                sets also have different assembly languages.

                High-level languages made the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable, 
                and less bound to the underlying hardware. FORTRAN, <span id=firstprogram></span>the first</span> widely used high-level language to
                have a functional implementation, came out in 1957[10] and many other languages were soon 
                developed – in particular, COBOL aimed at commercial data processing, and Lisp for computer research.

                <span id= punched>Programs </span>were mostly still entered using punched cards or paper tape.
                See computer programming in the punch card era. By the late 1960s, data storage devices
                and computer terminals became inexpensive enough that programs could be created by typing 
                directly into the computers. Text editors (programs themselves) were developed that allowed 
                changes and corrections to be made much more easily than with punched cards.

                Programming language and List of programming languages
                Different programming languages support different styles of programming (called programming paradigms). The choice of language used is subject to many considerations, such as company policy, suitability to task, availability of third-party packages, or individual preference. Ideally, the programming language best suited for the task at hand will be selected. Trade-offs from this ideal involve finding enough programmers who know the language to build a team, the availability of compilers for that language, and the efficiency with which programs written in a given language execute. Languages form an approximate spectrum from "low-level" to "high-level"; "low-level" languages are typically more machine-oriented and faster to execute, whereas "high-level" languages are more abstract and easier to use but execute less quickly. It is usually easier to code in "high-level" languages than in "low-level" ones.

                Allen Downey, in his book How To Think Like A Computer Scientist, writes:

                The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language:
                Input: Gather data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.
                Output: Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.
                Arithmetic: Perform basic arithmetical operations like addition and multiplication.
                Conditional Execution: Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of statements.
                Repetition: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.
                Many computer languages provide a mechanism to call functions provided by shared libraries. Provided the functions in a library follow the appropriate run-time conventions (e.g., method of passing arguments), then these functions may be written in any other language.
